# Project Manager
A website to help you keep track of your projects. Are you working on a huge project, or do you want to reach a goal? Project Manager can help you by allowing you to create a project,
assign tasks and due-dates to the projects, and create due-dates so you can stay on track!

# Technologies

Project Manager is a Python-based web application. The front-end is created primarily through HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. These technologies allow the website to have a interactive component for the user.\
On the back-end side, Project Manager is built using Flask. Flask allows the project to load web pages, process data, and provide web-routes. Additionally, Flask also comes with Werkeug, a library that enables
Project Manager to perform user authentication and store passwords.\ 
Finally, a PostgreSQL database stores essential data like user information and their projects and task.

# Upcoming features

Moving forward, there are some quality of life changes that can be made to the website. For example, a home-page is a necessary step for this project. Additionally, there are some 
cool features that I want to implement, such as a Twilio-based notification system.
